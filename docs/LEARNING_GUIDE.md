# DevOps Learning Guide

## üìö Core Concepts Covered

### 1. Containerization with Docker

**What you'll learn:**
- Container vs Virtual Machine concepts
- Dockerfile best practices
- Multi-stage builds
- Security considerations

**Commands to try:**
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t my-devops-project .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-devops-project

# Check container health
docker ps
docker logs <container_id>

# Execute commands inside container
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh
```

### 2. Container Orchestration

**What you'll learn:**
- Multi-container applications
- Service networking
- Volume management
- Load balancing

**Commands to try:**
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Scale services
docker-compose up -d --scale app=3

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### 3. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

**What you'll learn:**
- Automated testing pipelines
- Build automation
- Security scanning
- Deployment strategies

**Key features:**
- Automated testing on multiple Node.js versions
- Docker image building and testing
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Code quality checks

### 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**What you'll learn:**
- Configuration management
- Environment consistency
- Version control for infrastructure

### 5. Monitoring and Observability

**What you'll learn:**
- Health checks
- Logging strategies
- Performance monitoring
- Alerting

**Endpoints to monitor:**
- `GET /health` - Application health status
- `GET /` - Main application endpoint
- `GET /info` - Application information

## üîß Local Development Setup

1. **Install Prerequisites:**
   ```bash
   # Node.js and npm
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
   nvm install --lts
   
   # Docker
   # Follow official Docker installation guide for your OS
   
   # Docker Compose
   # Usually included with Docker Desktop
   ```

2. **Clone and Setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Petchzz02/-my-devops-project.git
   cd -my-devops-project
   npm install
   ```

3. **Development Workflow:**
   ```bash
   # Run locally
   npm run dev
   
   # Run tests
   npm test
   
   # Check code quality
   npm run lint
   
   # Build and run with Docker
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## üöÄ Deployment Strategies

### 1. Development Environment
- Local development with hot reload
- Local Docker containers for testing

### 2. Staging Environment
- Docker containers
- Automated testing
- Security scanning

### 3. Production Environment
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes/Docker Swarm)
- Load balancing
- Monitoring and logging
- Backup and disaster recovery

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

1. **Container Security:**
   - Use non-root user
   - Minimal base images
   - Regular security updates
   - Vulnerability scanning

2. **Code Security:**
   - Dependency scanning
   - Static code analysis
   - Secrets management
   - Input validation

3. **Infrastructure Security:**
   - Network segmentation
   - Access controls
   - Encryption in transit and at rest
   - Regular security audits

## üìä Monitoring and Metrics

### Application Metrics
- Request count and response times
- Error rates and status codes
- Resource utilization (CPU, Memory)
- Custom business metrics

### Infrastructure Metrics
- Container health and restart counts
- Resource consumption
- Network traffic
- Storage utilization

### Logging Strategy
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Centralized log aggregation
- Log rotation and retention
- Security event logging

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Advanced Docker:**
   - Multi-stage builds
   - Docker networking
   - Volume management
   - Security scanning

2. **Kubernetes:**
   - Pod and service management
   - ConfigMaps and Secrets
   - Ingress controllers
   - Helm charts

3. **Advanced CI/CD:**
   - Deployment strategies (Blue-Green, Canary)
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing
   - Automated rollbacks

4. **Monitoring & Observability:**
   - Prometheus and Grafana
   - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
   - Distributed tracing
   - APM (Application Performance Monitoring)

5. **Infrastructure as Code:**
   - Terraform
   - Ansible
   - CloudFormation
   - Pulumi

**Remember:** The best way to learn DevOps is by doing. Experiment with the code, break things, and fix them. Every failure is a learning opportunity! üöÄ
