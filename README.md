# My DevOps Practice Project

This is my first DevOps practice project, designed to learn and demonstrate core DevOps principles, tools, and practices.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project serves as a hands-on learning platform for DevOps concepts including:
- Containerization with Docker
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Monitoring and Logging
- Security best practices
- Automated testing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Node.js (for local development)

### Running the Application
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Petchzz02/-my-devops-project.git
cd -my-devops-project

# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or run locally
npm install
npm start
```

## 🛠 DevOps Tools & Technologies

### Containerization
- **Docker**: Application containerization
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container orchestration

### CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows for testing, building, and deployment

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Health Checks**: Application monitoring
- **Logging**: Centralized log management

### Code Quality
- **Linting**: Code style and quality checks
- **Testing**: Automated unit and integration tests
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection
